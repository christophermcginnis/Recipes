    <h1>Kalbi (Korean BBQ Short Ribs)</h1>
    <div class="header">
        <p>This is the <strong>staple</strong> of Korean fine dining, but too expensive in the restaurants. It is also simple to make at home, and will leave your guests asking for more.<br>
       Total time includes marinating time. Traditionally, should be served sliced, rolled in romaine lettuce leaves, along with white rice, lightly browned garlic slices, and gochujang (Korean red pepper paste).</p>

    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            In a bowl, stir together the soy sauce, brown sugar, water, garlic, green onions, and sesame oil until the sugar has dissolved.
        </li>
        <li>
            Place the ribs in a large plastic zipper bag. Pour the marinade over the ribs, squeeze out all the air, and refrigerate the bag for 3 hours to overnight.
        </li>
        <li>
            Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat, and lightly oil the grate. Remove the ribs from the bag, shake off the excess marinade, and discard the marinade.<br>
            Grill the ribs on the preheated grill until the meat is still pink but not bloody nearest the bone, 5 to 7 minutes per side.
