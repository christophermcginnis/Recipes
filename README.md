I'm coming back to The Odin Project almost a year after first starting it. The Odin Project inspired me to return to college in hopes of pursuing my dreams of becoming a software engineer and after having completed my first semester back with straight As, (not highly significant, but for someone that's 28 and never been particulary fond of school, this makes me very proud) I find it a good time to dive into web development and take it seriously. I hope to look back at this project in the future to see how far I've come. Hopefully.
